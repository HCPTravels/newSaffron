      description:'The saffron harvested in Pampore undergoes a traditional, time-honored process that includes gently drying the delicate stigmas after hand-picking. No artificial heat is used â€” instead, the drying is done slowly and carefully, preserving the saffronâ€™s natural oils, rich aroma, and medicinal properties. These ancient techniques, passed down through generations, ensure that the final product retains its purity, potency, and deep crimson color, making Kashmiri saffron truly exceptional.',

        description:'Packaging is more than presentation â€” itâ€™s protection. While most saffron is sold in plastic or clear glass that allows UV damage and scent contamination, we use UV-blocking metal tins and dark glass jars to preserve aroma and potency. To maintain its rich flavor and strength, saffron should be stored in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture. Every element of our packaging is designed to protect the purity of your saffron from harvest to your kitchen.',
